## What is Lungo for Mac?

Lungo is a lightweight and efficient utility designed for macOS that prevents your screen from sleeping or activating the screensaver. It is ideal for situations where you need your Mac to stay awake without manual intervention, such as during presentations, reading long documents, or watching tutorials.

The app sits discreetly in the menu bar, allowing you to enable or disable the screen awake feature with a single click. It does not consume significant system resources and runs smoothly in the background. Lungo is compatible with all recent versions of macOS, including Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, and Sonoma.

Whether you're using a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or a desktop Mac, Lungo ensures your display remains active for as long as you need. It is especially useful for developers, designers, students, and professionals who require an uninterrupted workflow.
